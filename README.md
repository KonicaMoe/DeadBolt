# DeadBolt
Python Fernet based encryption and decryption tool. Please have in mind that this is my first ever written programm so please be kind :) I pushed this for myself but go ahead if you want and try it

Well its pretty selfexplanatory so idk why i make this readme. You may have noticed that i dont sound very professional xD.

You can basicaly choose one of the displayed options to encrypt with password or with a keyfile. I have some cringey strong language in that garbage too so please, forgive
me for that.
